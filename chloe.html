  Bio- Chloe is the oldest dog. She is not as playful as she used to be but still does every once in awhile. Chloe had a slipped disc in her back and had to go through surgery a few years ago. She has made a full recovery even though they were not sure if she'd walk again. She is nick-named the million dollar dog because of all her surgeries. Her favorite activity is being a lap dog.

  Frequently Asked Questions-
    </p>
    <p>
      What happened to her teeth? Chloe got an infection that attacked her teeth and gums. The vet recommened a full teeth removal to handle the infection. She is fine without teeth and many old dogs must face the same thing.
