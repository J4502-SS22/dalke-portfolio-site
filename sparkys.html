    Bio- Georgia is the most recent edition to the family. She needed a new home and as soon as my mom saw her she knew she belonged with us, much to my dads surprise. Georgia does not have a mean bone in her body and loves getting pets. Her favorite activity is to walk around from person to person at the dog park and get love.
